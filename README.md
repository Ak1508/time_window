## time_window
Here I have a code to produce AdcTDc time diff for Cerenkov and Calorimeter for both spectrometer.
Code will basically produce the plots for no hit selection and hit selections .
To run code we need to load ROOT files by doing root -l /path/ to/ rootfile/filename.root.
then T->Process("SHMS(HMS)Gates.C").
